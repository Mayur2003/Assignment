          Cross-browser compatibility issues. What works with one browser might not always work with another, so web
          developers need to test for compatibility across multiple browsers.
    
          <br><br>
          Confusion due to its many levels. CSS has many levels, which can be complicated for non-developers and beginners.
          <br><br>
    
          Fixing not only one CSS file but also HTML tags associated with CSS selectors is often necessary.

        <summary>canvas and SVG tags</summary>
    
        <p>
          <br>
          Use the HTML canvas element with either the canvas scripting API or the WebGL API to draw graphics and animations.
                    <br><br>

                    The exact maximum size of a canvas element depends on the browser and environment. While in most cases the maximum dimensions exceed 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, notably iOS devices limit the canvas size to only 4,096 x 4,096 pixels.  
             <br><br>
    
             It is better to specify your canvas dimensions by setting the width and height attributes directly on the canvas elements, either directly in the HTML or by using JavaScript

          SVG Tag In Html5

          <br> <br>
          The svg element is a container that defines a new coordinate system and viewport. It is used as the outermost element of SVG documents, but it can also be used to embed an SVG fragment inside an SVG or HTML document.
        
          <br>
           In this example, the height and width attributes on the svg element are set using the dynamic viewport value 60vmin, equivalent to 60% of the viewport's width or height, whichever is smaller.
